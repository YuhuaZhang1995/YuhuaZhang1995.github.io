I am Yuhua Zhang, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University working with [Prof. JP Onnela](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/jp-onnela/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Walter Dempsey](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/dempsey-walter.html) and [Prof. Sebastian ZÃ¶llner](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zollner-sebastian.html). Before that, I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics in 2019 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked with [Prof. William Wen](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/wen-xiaoquan.html). I received my B.S. in Biological Science in 2017 at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and had the opportunity to complete my undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Hongyu Zhao](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/hongyu_zhao/) as an exchange student at Yale University.

My research to date has focused on data-inspired method development in the theme of networks. Direct
study of network data provides a powerful tool to investigate phenomena that non-network approaches fail to
capture. Beyond that, network context enables evaluation of intervention effects that conventional analyses
miss, improving statistical power and inference accuracy. Going forward, I will expand on developing new
approaches for network data modeling and causal inference in networks.

**Keywords**: network data analysis, causal inference with network interference, Bayesian nonparametric methods, community detection, latent class models

I currently live in Boston, and I am ready for adventures to any place in the world. I am happy to learn, talk, meet people from all sorts of fields (perfect if over a cup of coffee :D). Please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to chat!
